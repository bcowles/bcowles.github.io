	<p>Mission: To educate people on their media consumption and how it can affect their outlook.</p>
	<p>History: Inspired by the reading diaries of Nick Hornby, i started cataloging what i was watching, listening, reading, playing, etc. What I thought were fun distractions took up lots of time and shaped my thinking.</p>
	<hr>

	<p>Content tracking:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>TV</li>
		<li>Books and magazines</li>
		<li>Music</li>
		<li>Podcasts</li>
		<li>Movies</li>
		<li>Games</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Services will teach people how to track and analyze their content. Time spent is as important as what was consumed.</p>

	<p>Favorites will come to the surface. See what leads to procrastination. Understand what's taking root in your brain.</p>
