					<p>I started this site to provide fun recipes for the whole family to enjoy.</p>
					<p>Why is this important to me? I grew up in a bakery, learning to knead dough before I turned 2. From an early age I was drawn to the yeasty arts. Baking was a gateway into cooking and discovering how magical food could be.</p>
					<p>It's the first thing I learned from my family and it's the most important thing I can share.</p>

			<h2>My Favorite Cookie:</h2>

			<h4>Cake Batter Rice Crispy Treats</h4>
			<p>Total Time: 40 mins</p>
			<p>Prep Time: 30 Mins</p>
			<p>Cook Time: 10 mins</p>

			<p>Ingredients:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 Tbsp butter</li>
				<li>1 10oz bag of mini-marshmallows</li>
				<li>1/2 cup yellow cake mix</li>
				<li>5 cups crispy rice cereal</li>
				<li>1 (1.75oz) container of sprinkles</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Directions:</p>
			<p>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat and add marshmallows. Stir until they begin to melt, then remove from heat. Whisk in the (dry) cake mix, then stir in cereal so it is completely coated with marshmallow mixture. Sprinkle in half of the sprinkles and briefly stir. (Donâ€™t stir too much or the sprinkles will bleed out their color.) Press the mixture into a baking dish (any size will do) and top with remaining sprinkles. Let sit for about 30 minutes before cutting. I find spraying a knife with nonstick spray helps to cut them cleanly.</p>
